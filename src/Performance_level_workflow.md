# Performance Level


  **1. Introduction**

In the automation of gear deburring, Cartesian machines are employed to remove sharp edges and burrs from gear teeth, enhancing gear quality and lifespan. A critical aspect of the system's design is its performance level, which ensures reliable, efficient, and safe operations. This chapter defines the required performance level for a Cartesian machine designed for deburring gears, focusing on integrating a vision system to guide the deburring path and detailing how these requirements are determined and implemented.

**2. Scope and Objectives**

The primary objective is to define the required performance level and outline its implementation within a Cartesian deburring system, addressing:

- Precision and repeatability needed for effective deburring.
- The integration and role of a vision system in guiding the deburring tool.
- Safety and reliability to mitigate risks during the process.
- Compliance with industry standards governing performance levels in automated systems.

**3. Understanding Performance Level (PL)**

Performance Level (PL) quantifies the reliability of safety functions in machinery, as defined by standards like ISO 13849-1. It is determined using a structured approach that considers risks, exposure, and necessary control measures. PL is categorized from PL a (lowest safety requirement) to PL e (highest safety requirement). The performance level ensures that the machine performs its functions safely and reliably, even in the presence of failures.

**4. Required Performance Level for the Cartesian Deburring Machine**

Based on the intended use and associated risks, the Cartesian deburring machine must meet a Performance Level d (PL d) requirement. This level is chosen based on the following considerations:

- Risk Severity: The deburring process involves rotating tools and automated motion, which can pose significant risks to operators and machinery in the event of a malfunction.
- Frequency of Exposure: Maintenance and operational adjustments may require regular human interaction, increasing the likelihood of exposure to hazards.
- Risk Reduction Measures: With adequate safeguards, such as emergency stop systems and redundant sensors, PL d provides a balance between safety and system complexity.

A PL d ensures a high level of reliability for the machineâ€™s safety functions, effectively mitigating risks without imposing excessive design complexity.

**5. Key Performance Level Requirements**

For the Cartesian deburring machine to meet PL d, the following parameters are critical:

- Accuracy and Repeatability: Ensuring consistent gear quality.
- Vision System Reliability: Detecting gear profiles accurately and guiding the tool path.
- Safety Mechanisms: Including emergency stop systems, anomaly detection, and redundant components to prevent damage or injuries.

**6. Risk Analysis and Determination of Performance Level**

The determination of PL involves a step-by-step risk analysis:

- Risk Identification: Analyze hazards like tool breakage, unexpected stops, or incorrect tool paths.
- Risk Estimation: Evaluate the severity of possible injuries and frequency of exposure.
- Risk Reduction Measures: Implement controls to reduce risks, such as physical barriers, sensor redundancy, and self-diagnostic systems.

Given the severity and frequency of potential risks, the Cartesian machine must operate at a PL d to ensure a safe and reliable process.


**7. Implementation of Performance Level in Design**

To meet the PL d requirements:

- Control Systems: Use reliable and fail-safe controllers for the Cartesian machine and vision system.
- Redundant Systems: Incorporate redundant sensors to maintain operation during component failure.
- Monitoring and Maintenance: Implement predictive maintenance strategies to monitor tool wear and system calibration, reducing the likelihood of failure.

**8. Role of Vision System in Achieving Performance Level**

The vision system is integral to achieving PL d by enhancing the machine's accuracy and safety:

- Path Generation: High-resolution imaging ensures precise tool paths.
- Real-Time Processing: Enables immediate adjustment to gear variations.
- Error Detection: Halts operations when anomalies are detected, minimizing risk.

**9. Compliance with Standards**

Adherence to industry standards such as ISO 13849-1, ISO 12100, and ISO 10218 ensures the Cartesian machine meets safety and performance benchmarks. These standards guide the design and implementation of safety-related control systems and risk mitigation strategies.

**10. Conclusion**

The Cartesian deburring machine must meet a performance level of PL d, ensuring its safe and effective operation. By integrating a vision system, adhering to rigorous safety protocols, and complying with relevant standards, the system can reliably achieve high-quality deburring while mitigating operational risks. The determination and implementation of the required PL d are foundational to the machine's design, ensuring its alignment with both operational and safety expectations.
