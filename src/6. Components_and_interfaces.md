package "Operator" {
    [Input machine] as opPut
    [Quality control] as opQuality
    [Output of machine] as opGet
}

package "Base Frame" {
    [Cartesian robot] as robot
    [Tool] as tool
    [Vision system] as vision
}

package "Industrial PC" {
    [Gear measurement] as pcDimensions
    [Travel path creator] as pcPath
    [Force measurement] as pcForce
}

opPut --> robot : "Gear clamp"
vision --> pcDimensions : "Image by RS232"
pcDimensions --> pcPath : "Image"
pcPath --> robot : "Coordinates send by pyads"
robot --> tool : "Start signal"
tool --> tool : "Stop signal"
tool --> pcForce : "Analog signal by wires"
pcForce --> opQuality : "Force data by HMI"
opQuality --> opGet : "Ready signal"
